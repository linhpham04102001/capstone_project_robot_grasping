# capstone_project_robot_grasping
This is my capstone project of my team and ITSC Company. This project aims to applicate computer vision in industrial robot. The hardware is providing by ITSC. We will code the software from computer vision unit, winform app and controller to control robot.
In this project, we use camera of IMITECH, this is a industrial camera. This camera was fixed, this camera will catch an image from a tray, that had a lot of objects, that objects might lay up, lay down, lay in vertical, lay in horizontal or lay on each others. We must detect all objects lay up on tray for robot grasping.
To run this source, firstly we must prepare a environment for cvu, we use conda to create it by command:
